<h1>All About Cassidy</h1>
<h2>A Student at The University of Maine</h2>

<p>Welcome to my website! I created this webpage to share information about myself. I hope you enjoy getting to know me!</p>
<p>My name is Cassidy Smith. I am 19 years old and currently a student at
    <a href="https://umaine.edu"> The University of Maine.</a>
    I just transferred here for the Spring 2019 Semester from Stonehill College in Massachusetts. As of right now, I am undecided on what major I want to pursue, but I'm strongly leaning towards business. I am very eager to learn and I hope to learn the skills it takes to be a successful buisnesswoman someday.</p>
